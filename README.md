# Projects
This repository contains Audrey's projects, focusing on data-driven equity analysis (Alternative Data Strategy), trading strategy development (Cornell Trading Competition Strategy), and general data analytics (Ooperations Research project).

## 1. Alternative Data-Driven Stock Trend Analysis

Analyzed TikTok hashtag engagement data to predict stock price movements in the athletic fashion sector (e.g., Lululemon, Nike).
- Built predictive models using social media alternative data.
- Achieved Sharpe Ratio of 1.90 and ROI of 2.8% in backtesting.
- Focused on the relationship between consumer trends and equity performance.

## 2. Quantitative Trading Strategy Implementation

Developed and backtested a quantitative trading strategy for the Cornell Trading Competition in 2024. Market data is from the CTC-2024-Derivatives dataset.
- Constructed trading signals and executed systematic backtests.
- Evaluated strategy performance using Sharpe Ratio and maximum drawdown metrics.

## 3. Operations Research and Information Engineering Scheduling Research

Analyzed historical course registration data to create a conflict matrix guaranteeing no co-enrollment between a course and its prerequisites. This matrix served as a key input for our groupâ€™s ML models predicting future enrollment trends.
- Parsed and standardized prerequisite relationships using custom regex functions and API data extraction.
- Constructed an adjacency matrix of course relationships. Applied the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find transitive closure (not just direct prereqs but indirect ones too).
- Generated a conflict matrix to optimize exam scheduling under resource and policy constraints.
